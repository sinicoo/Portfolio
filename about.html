            <p>Hello! My name is Nico. In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with making websites. I am an FPS player who loves dogs and cars. I have 4 dogs, namely Sophie, Borris, Taco, and Kendi. I studied at Philippine School Doha, Our Lady of Fatima University, and currently I am a senior Computer Science student at Holy Angel University, with a solid foundation in software development, algorithms, and data structures, and a strong focus on becoming a Back-end Developer. I have experience with programming languages like Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Dart, along with knowledge in cloud computing. I am eager to expand my skills and deepen my understanding of technology through diverse projects.</p>
